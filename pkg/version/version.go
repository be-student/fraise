// Version is the release identity compiled into every binary, and the single
// place the version number lives in the tree.

// The trailing annotation is release-please's marker: when it opens a release
// PR it rewrites the literal on this line to the version being cut, in the same
// commit that updates CHANGELOG.md, and tags that commit on merge. The tag and
// this constant therefore cannot drift — do not edit it by hand.
//
// GoReleaser additionally overrides it via -ldflags -X on a release build. The
// linker only rewrites string variables that are uninitialized or set to a
// constant expression, so this must stay a plain literal — never computed.
